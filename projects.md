I have worked on a variety of Projects during my time at Intuit, India as well as during my undergraduate studies at [NITK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology_Karnataka). A brief description of each of these projects are below.

## Intuit
### API-Gateway and Service Registry
<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
The <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/API-gateway-application-programming-interface-gateway" target="_blank">API-Gateway</a> provides common functionality like authentication, authorization, throttling etc for web-services behind it. The <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html" target="_blank">Service Registry</a> is a centralized data-store that has the configuration metadata for the web-services in the enterprise. Although, I was on the gateway registry team for only a brief period, the learning was incredible. Was exposed to Microservice Architecture, Software Design Patterns, Web-Services, DevOps terminologies(deployment and failover strategies) and much more.
</p>

### Application and Network health monitoring tools: 
<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
Built full stack applications that fetched data from a warehouse and created easy to use monitoring tools that helped narrow down source of application and network outages. Being one of the first engineers on this team, I routinely demonstrated the abilities of these tools to engineers, architects and senior leadership at Intuit.
</p>
### Test Execution Platform
<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
This was my first project at Intuit, India. TEP provided testing infrastructure for web and mobile applications as a service. I was a lead developer on TEP mobile, where we built an on-demand cross-platform(Android,iOS) testing grid for use by all of Intuit product teams.
</p>

### Misc: 
Routinely participated in hackathons and built solutions that eventually made it to TEP production.

## NITK 
### CampusConnect
<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
CampusConnect was a platform for effective campus communcation. I was a co-founder and technical lead working across the full-stack consisting of Android clients powered by a python backend on Google App Engine. We received 5000+ downloads and a pre-seed grant of INR 300,000. This was my first experience of building market ready products and really molded my software development and leadership abilities.
