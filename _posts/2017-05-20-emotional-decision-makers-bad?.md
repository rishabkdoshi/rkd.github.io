<b><i>People who make decisions based on emotion and justify those decisions with logic afterwards are poor decision makers.

The statement says that people who take decisions based on emotions and later justify these decisions logically are poor decision makers. I feel that this statement is too extreme in its treatment of people who take decisions based on emotions.

Firstly, it is important to note that not all decisions taken based on emotions turn out to be bad decisions. For example: If a person is at an inflection point at his/her career, and in order to get that next promotion he/she needs to move from New York to California. At the same time he/she is responsible for the well being of his/her parents, younger siblings. In such cases if the person decides not to take the promotion in order to take care of his/her dependents. This decision may appear to others as an impractical decision driven by emotions, however this is a necessary decision when viewed from the eyes of the decision maker.

Further it is important be cognizant of the fact that people take a lot of decisions on an everyday basis and all decisions are not of the same importance or have the same magnitude. So judging a person as a poor decision maker just based on the fact that he/she is making few decisions driven by emotions would be illogical. For example: If a person started the day on a bad note and makes a poor dressing choice, this decision was affected by the persons emotions at the point of making the decision, but labelling the person as a poor decision maker just by a trivial decision like poor dressing is flawed. The same person could be very decisive in terms of where his/her investments should be made and might even have extremely clear life goals. If the person is capable of making such byzantine decisions, it would be imprudent to label him/her as a poor decision maker.

At the same time if a person makes a poor decision which is not as trivial and has dire consequences, if the person is justifying the poor decision made, it is an indication that the person is trying to bring forth a point of view which is not very obvious but made sense to the decision maker at the point of time of making the decision. The decision maker trying to justify the decision is also representative of the fact that the person is willing to be accountable for the decisions he/she has made and wants to take everyone into confidence about a possible lapse of judgement. For example: If a football team A is playing a game and it is the last game for player X, if the coach decides to give player X a chance to play despite X not being in the greatest of form. This decision is based on an emotion. If team A ends up losing it will appear as a rash decision by the coach to let player X take on the field. However the coach justifies this decision saying that the team A had already qualified for the playoffs and it didn't hurt to let player X take the field, considering that X had contributed so much to the team. This decision which initially appears rash doesn't really turn out to be rash on closer inspection.
So it can be clearly seen that not all decisions that are taken are of equal importance, some that are driven by emotions may turn out to be bad, but if logically justified it may bring out views that may not have been anticipated.
