This book was published just a few months after Hans Rosling passed away. An incredible read where Hans and team have beautifully provided a data-driven framework to look at the world and societies. He asks a fundamental set of questions on health care, disasters, environmental change, societal development etc. and asks the reader to guess the answers. He then proves that most audiences of the survey tend to select unoptimistic answers for all the questions. He then goes on to reveal the correct answers and then proposes a framework to look at the world. Through his life stories he demonstrates various instincts like urgency, fear etc., which make us feel unoptimistic/dejected about world conditions and then provides a factfull way of looking at the world. Highly recommended read.

Some interesting highlights from the book:

* <i>Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent, and more hopeless—in short, more dramatic—than it really is.</i>
* <i>I decided to start doing more than just testing knowledge and exposing ignorance. I decided to try to understand why. Why was this ignorance about the world so widespread and so persistent?</i>
* <i>Step-by-step, year-by-year, the world is improving. Not on every single measure every single year, but as a rule. Though the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress. This is the fact-based worldview.</i>
* <i>need to learn to control our drama intake. Uncontrolled, our appetite for the dramatic goes too far, prevents us from seeing the world as it is, and leads us terribly astray.</i>
* <i>Factfulness, like a healthy diet and regular exercise, can and should become part of your daily life.</i>
* <i>Misconceptions disappear only if there is some equally simple but more relevant way of thinking to replace them.</i>
* <i>Culture and freedom, the goals of development, can be hard to measure, but guitars per capita is a good proxy. And boy, has that improved.</i>
* <i>“Warning: Objects in Your Memories Were Worse Than They Appear</i>
* <i>“possibilist.” That’s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.</i>
* <i> When we are afraid, we do not see clearly.</i>
