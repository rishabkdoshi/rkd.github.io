Found this to be a very interesting book by Satya Nadella. He demonstrates how each of his life stages(schooling in India, love for cricket, parental experiences) have influenced his opinions and decisions he's made through the years at Microsoft. He then talks about the importance of culture in an organization, the struggles associated with bringing about a cultural transformation and then goes on to attribute the gains seen by Microsoft in recent years to its successful cultural transformation. He goes on to give his perspectives on technology's role in future societies specifically upcoming areas like Artificial Intelligence concluding by sharing his optimism about the future.

Some interesting highlights from the book:

* <i>Ideas excite me. Empathy grounds and centers me.</i>
* <i>If you could understand impermanence deeply, you would develop more equanimity. You would not get too excited about either the ups or downs of life.</i>
* <i>“the future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.”</i>
* <i>I said that I was honored, humbled, and excited. They were unplanned words, but they perfectly captured how I felt.</i>
* <i>you must always have respect for your competitor, but don’t be in awe. Go and compete.</i>
* <i>Steve Jobs understood what the soul of a company is. He once said that “design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.”</i>
* <i>“consistency is better than perfection.”</i>
* <i>“At the end of the next year if we were tried in a court of law and the charge was that we failed to pursue our mission, would there be enough evidence to convict us?”</i>
* <i>Trust is not only dependent on our technology but also the legal framework that governs it.</i>
* <i> we want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences. </i>
* <i>computer pioneer Alan Kay quips, “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” In the AI context, he’s basically saying, Stop predicting what the future will be like; instead, create it in a principled way.</i>
* <i>In software development terms, AI is becoming a third run time—the next system on top of which programmers will build and execute applications.</i>
* <i>∑ (Education + Innovation) x Intensity of Tech Use = Economic Growth</i>
* <i>“Business is humanity’s most resilient, iterative, and productive mechanism for creating change in the world.”</i>
